# Workforce Skill Gap & Training Needs Dashboard | HR Analytics with Power BI

This project explores a simulated HR dataset to help leadership teams understand where the biggest skill gaps lie in the organization — and who needs training the most.

It’s not just a dashboard that says “this team needs help.” It goes a step further and shows:
- Which departments and job roles are falling behind
- What specific skills need urgent attention
- Who might leave the company if nothing changes
- And what happens if we *actually train people properly*

The goal was simple: turn training data into business action.

## What This Dashboard Covers

| Area | What You'll Find |
|------|------------------|
| **Skill Gaps** | Visual breakdown of where skill gaps are most severe across departments |
| **Training Needs** | Who needs training, what they need, and how it differs by role, skill, and department |
| **Before vs After Simulation** | What would happen if we fixed 60% of the flagged training needs? (spoiler: a lot improves) |
| **High-Risk Employees** | Employees with large gaps, no training planned, and at risk of quitting |
| **Demographic Insights** | Training needs sliced by age group, education, and job level |

## Tools Used

- **Power BI** – for data modeling and dashboard development

## Key Business Takeaways

- Departments like **R&D** and **HR** are falling the furthest behind on skill levels.
- Training isn’t one-size-fits-all — **Communication**, **CRM tools**, and **Strategic Planning** top the list.
- If training were delivered based on current needs, **skill gaps could drop by over 60%**.
- Over **130 employees** with major gaps are unflagged for training and show **attrition risk** — these are urgent.

## Why This Project Matters

Every company says “people are our biggest asset,” but few can **actually measure** where that asset needs investment.

This dashboard brings visibility and actionability into one place — no jargon, no fluff, just decision-ready insights.

Whether you’re in HR, L&D, or leadership — this is the kind of dashboard that tells you *exactly* what needs to be done next.
